# FireChat

FireChat is a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate with each other seamlessly. This project is built using modern web technologies, including Vite, React (with TypeScript), Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. FireChat offers a range of features to enhance your chatting experience, including active user tracking, message sending with acknowledgments, message delivery and read notifications.

## Features

1. **List of Active Users**
   - FireChat provides a list of active users who are currently online. This helps you quickly identify and chat with your friends or colleagues in real time.

2. **Message Sending with Acknowledgment**
   - When you send a message, you will see a single tick next to the message indicating that the server has received your message. This acknowledgment ensures that your message was successfully sent.

3. **Message Delivery Notification**
   - FireChat goes a step further by providing a double tick icon when your message is delivered to the recipient's client. This ensures that your message has reached the intended recipient's device.

4. **Message Read Notification**
   - When the recipient opens and reads your message, you will see a blue double tick icon next to the message. This lets you know that your message has been seen by the recipient.

## Tech Stack

FireChat is built using the following technologies:

- **Vite**: Vite is used as the build tool and development server, offering fast and efficient development and production workflows.

- **React with TypeScript**: The front-end of FireChat is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.

- **Firebase**: Firebase provides the real-time database and authentication system for FireChat, enabling seamless real-time chat functionality and user management.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. It offers a utility-first approach to CSS, making it easy to create beautiful and responsive designs.
